The MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) is one of the most popular architectures among all and one of the
 most used ones in mobile application development. As a learning process, I have built this
  project which is a simple note saver application. I have implemented features like 
  
  * Create Note
  * Update Note
  * Delete Note
  * Display All Notes
  * Update & Delete Animation
  
 Tools that I have used: 
 
 1. Room
 2. ViewModel
 3. LiveData
 4. SQLite Database
 5. RecyclerView
 
All of these are available in Android Architecture Components library. [Click here](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture) to know more.
